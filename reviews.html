                <p>"Daintree Magic Hideaway & One of the best spots in the World"<br />
                I have stayed with friends and family at this magical Oasis very many times. The architecture of the building is absolutely 
dynamic, so spacious with massive high ceilings. There is an enormous amount of glass windows that let the natural light in 
with the beautiful rainforest and ocean views in the background. Margaret, Charlie, Frank and the entire family are generous, 
kind are the most welcoming people I have ever met in my life. This fantastic place is a must to see on your list. You will 
never forget the magical moments at this extremely rare property. A big thank you to the Barn Family.

                <p>Incredible house located in the rainforest! The pictures are nothing. The house is so big, and there is nothing you could wish for, 
that is not already there. 2 minutes by car to the next beach, which is so beautiful and lonely!! Only two or three other people 
were there! It is much better most of the Carribean beaches. The house has so many verandas and an amazing pool! The view down to 
the beach and the sunrise is unbelievable. We had full moon, which made the view during the nighttime amazing as well. 
I would definetely come back!!

                <p>This house is ideal for those looking for a quiet, relaxing retreat. There are no (human) neighbours to be seen or heard. 
Only the distant sound of the ocean and local wildlife. Francis, the owner, made us feel very welcome by showing us around 
the house and giving us a rundown of all the activities in the region. The Barn is a very large residence suitable for 
families or small groups. with brilliant ocean views and a fantastic pool. This is a well equipped home 
(games, TV, pool, billiard table, BBQ, washing machine and dishwasher We would have loved to stay a few more days!

visiting the ice cream store, and relaxing while watching the beautiful view in sunshine or rain. Our 2 year old had a great time too, and the cassowary and lizards up close were amazing

                <p>Awesome place extremely welcoming owner Frank & Sing. The Barn is 5 star in a lot of ways but if you want luxury this is not the
 place for you. Its an amazing house, ramshackle and homely, with lots of aged lived in areas, we couldn't have picked a better 
place for our mad family. We played games till we cried and laughing, we walked until we felt like our legs would fall off, 
we dined and drank on every deck area we could in the house and the sunrises were mind blowing to watch on the balconies 
while looking over the sea. LOVED IT xx

                <p>"Fabulous Eco-glamour"<br />
The Barn - what an incredible experience. The exceptional manner of Sing, who organises bookings and relays information prior to arrival, really sets the tone of what unfolds to be a stay of absolute magic and bliss. Our jaws hit the floor when we arrived at the Barn for the start of our 7 day stay. It is a beautiful place, with soaring ceilings and supremely comfortable spaces. The pool is sublime - deep and long with views across the rainforest to the ocean. It didn't take long for the kids to 'accidently' fall, fully clothed, into the lovely clear water. There are games on hand, a book case with a decent range of books, a dart board and pool table, which kept us entertained when we weren't in the pool. Our greatest pleasure was the wide variety of insects that paraded past us, enjoying their natural habitat - we saw 3 different types of stick insect on the lower deck alone. Perhaps one of the most outstanding aspects of our time at the house was that Frank, the owner, met us at the start of our stay to show us around and help us settle in. Frank is very relaxed and amiable. As he left, he advised us to "make ourselves at home, explore and help ourselves to anything we need". There were no 'rules', no forbidden areas, and it really did feel like the Barn was our home for the week. We were appreciative of this, and felt it was very special. We wouldn't change a thing about this wonderful place, and we plan to make a return visit, possibly at a different time of year to check out what other of Natures marvels might rear their heads.</p>

                <p>The pictures do not do this house justice, it's so much more impressive than you would imagine! Francis was the most welcoming person, greeting us at the house and showing us around - you will need to hear the history of the house for yourselves, it has great stories attached to it and you can feel this within the house (and you can see why Marlon Brando stayed here!) The pool was far bigger than expected and we swam each morning, with views of the ocean. The bedrooms were a delight, all with beautiful views of the coast and rainforest. Walking to Cow Bay was lovely, the pool table within the house fun. If you're looking for a modern, spotless, uptight house, this is not for you - the fittings are older, but this actually adds to the charm and the genuine feel of house. The windows are extraordinary and light fills the entire space from sunrise to sunset. If we did not live in England, we would choose this house every single summer to spend time here! Thank you Francis, we loved our time at your house.</p>

                <p>"Magical Experience"<br /> We were lucky enough to be the first ever paying guests at �The Barn�, a house built some 25 years ago by the mother of the current owner, Frank. On arrival our breath was taken away by the house and its spectacular location.<br /><br />

The house is beautifully designed and built predominantly of timber. The living area is massive with soaring cathedral ceilings over two stories in height. The inclusion of extensive banks of windows and bifold doors creates a wonderful connection with the surrounding rainforest and views to Cow Bay.<br /><br />

The property has an exceptional feeling of exclusivity � we could have been the only two people in the entire world, with not a sign (or sound) of any other humans or human habitation to be seen. Just the ocean and the ancient rainforest, although the activities and attractions of Cape Tribulation are not far away and are easily accessible.<br /><br /> 

The master bedroom on the top level is also huge with even more spectacular views if that were possible, complete with two comfy chairs & a table on the deck the better to enjoy wine and cheese and relax in the ultimate getaway location. A king bed and bathroom with oversize bath complete the picture.<br /><br /> 

The house is on three levels with massive decks on the lower two. There is a large well-equipped kitchen and an abundance of space, with furniture which matches the stunning and beautiful architecture of the house.<br /><br />

Unusually in this non mains-powered area north of the Daintree River, the house has sufficient solar panels and storage batteries to power a dishwasher and washing machine, both of which we used. Everything is on a generous scale � couches, tables, living spaces, pool, even the number of pots and pans. Peace and quiet, luxury and nature, adventure and wonder, all these you will find in the Daintree and The Barn. Wholeheartedly recommended.</p>

                <p>"Fantastic View!" <br />For us this was a truly unique property that my parents, my partner and I thought was terrific. It's a great place to unwind and relax out on the balcony with 'million dollar' views of the sea and surrounding forest.

The house really is something. You enter to the open-plan middle floor with high ceilings, a kitchen area, dinning area, sitting area, TV sitting area, full sized snooker table and a bathroom. 3 of the Barn's walls have floor to ceiling windows, which make you feel like you really are 'staying in the jungle'. One side can be completely opened up to the huge balcony that runs the length of the house and has a fantastic view of the sea. Just the perfect place to lounge around with a G&T reading a book, doing the crossword or having a BBQ!<br /><br />

Upstairs, the 'mezzanine', has a landing with space for 2 single beds (when we were there there was a large daybed). There is also a large master bedroom with huge ensuite and its own private balcony overlooking the sea. The bottom level has more outside decking, the pool and pool bar. On either side of the bar are 2 seperate bedrooms with their own bathrooms. There is also a laundry, garage and another bathroom. We went in August and the weather was perfect, so we didn't need to use the fans, plus the pool was great for a 'refreshing dip' after some 'jungle trekking.'<br /><br />

The grounds are fairly steep and heavily vegetated, but it's an easy walk out onto the road and it's only a 15min walk along the road to the unspoilt Cow bay. One morning we were fortunate enough to encounter 3 cassowaries crossing the front drive way!!<br /><br />

On arrival we were greeted by Frank the owner, who was very helpful and showed us around the property. It is important to note that the house is in the middle of forest and you do need to be conscious of electricity/water usage and any local visitors! There is also no WiFi, so you really can escape the outside world.<br /><br />

Just before the turn off from the main road to Cow Bay there is an Ice creamery and a pub/ bottle shop, which 'officially' stays open until 10pm, but closes earlier if there is no one there. If you are driving up from Cairns I do recommend you stop at the large Safeway in Mossman and stock up. (You can't miss it as it's on the main road). There are small grocery shops dotted around the Daintree, but most close early.<br /><br />

One thing to be made aware of is there are no curtains in the property. This means you'll wake up to a spectacular view of the sunrise, which for us was great. It also means that the place can get very dark during the night. This also applies to two of the downstairs bathrooms, which also have floor to ceiling windows on one wall.<br /><br />

Overall we found this place to be truly magic and a great place to escape and explore the Daintree.</p>

The kids were well entertained with all the games, wild life - they even spotted a Cassowary! Priceless!... over all it was truly a wonderful experience to have stayed at such an amazing place. We would love to come back & will be telling everyone who will listen about this little paradise...</p>
